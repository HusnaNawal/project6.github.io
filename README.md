Chat Application

This codes have been created for a group project for BCN3033 Network Programming subject with my other 4 team members. In this project, we were required to create 6 network functions, which are Socket(), Accept(), Execute(), ReadLine(), Write() and Thread(). In Java programming, there are three types of sockets: connection-oriented (TCP) sockets,
connectionless (UDP) sockets, and multicast sockets, which allow data to be sent to multiple
receivers. The chat application in this project is based on the UDP protocol. The server side of
the script will wait for the client before running. The server side will respond once the client has
been successfully connected. The programme will then be run in a terminal window or from a
command prompt.
